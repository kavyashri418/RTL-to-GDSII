# ðŸ§  RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program â€“ VSD

Welcome to my repository for the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**, a national-level initiative organized by **VSD (VLSI System Design)**. This program offers a **hands-on, end-to-end VLSI experience** â€” from **RTL design** all the way to **post-silicon validation** and **tapeout**.

## ðŸ“Œ Program Overview

> "The RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program is a national-level initiative to empower participants with real-world VLSI experience and to develop skilled Silicon Designers who don't just simulate â€” but fabricate."

This repository documents my journey and weekly progress through the program, focusing on:

- âœ… RTL Design & Simulation  
- âœ… Functional & Formal Verification  
- âœ… Synthesis using Open-Source Tools  
- âœ… Floorplanning, Placement, and Routing  
- âœ… Timing Analysis, DRC, and LVS  
- âœ… GDSII Generation and Tapeout Readiness  
- âœ… Post-Silicon Validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Program Goals

- Gain practical, end-to-end experience in VLSI SoC design.
- Learn and apply open-source EDA tools in real projects.
- Contribute to the fabrication of a working RISC-V-based SoC.
- Develop industry-relevant skills in RTL to GDSII flow.
