RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

Welcome to my RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program repository, where I will be documenting weekly tasks by emphasizing hands-on learning and end-to-end chip development - from RTL design to post-silicon validation.

"The RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program is an national-level initiative to empower participants with the most authentic VLSI experience and to create skilled Silicon Designers who don't just simulate-but fabricate".
