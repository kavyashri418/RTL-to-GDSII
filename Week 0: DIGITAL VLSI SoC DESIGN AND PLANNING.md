# 💻 Chip Design and Fabrication Flowchart

This repository describes the end-to-end **VLSI Chip Design and Fabrication Process**, starting from high-level modeling to factory tapeout. It outlines the steps involved in designing, verifying, integrating, and physically implementing a chip.

## 🗂 Flowchart Description

### 1. 💡 Chip Modelling
- Start with chip-level modeling.
- Create a **C model** to describe the functionality of the chip.

### 2. 🛠 GCC Compilation
- Compile C model specifications using **GCC**.

### 3. 📄 Specifications (C Model)
- Defines the specifications of the chip in C.
- Feeds into:
  - **🧪 Testbench Creation (C Language)**: Verifies the correctness of the chip model.
  - **🔧 Hardware Design (RTL - Verilog)**

### 4. 🔧 RTL Design
- Hardware described at the **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** using Verilog.
- Components:
  - **⚙️ Processor** → Synthesized into **Gate-Level Netlist (Synth PI)**
  - **🖧 Peripherals/IPs** → Converted into **Macros (Synth RTL)**
  - **🎛 Analog IPs** → Described at **Functional RTL Level**

### 5. 🧩 SoC Integration (GPIOs)
- Integrate processor, peripherals, macros, and analog IPs into a **System-on-Chip (SoC)**.

### 6. 🏗 Physical Design
- **Floorplanning, Placement, and Routing** of integrated design.

### 7. 🧩 Macro & Analog IP Integration
- Include **Hard/Soft Macros** and **Analog IP blocks** in the chip design.

### 8. 📐 GDSII Generation
- Translate design into **GDSII format**, the industry-standard file format for IC layout data.

### 9. ✅ Verification
- **DRC (Design Rule Check)** → Ensure layout follows manufacturing rules.
- **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic)** → Ensure layout matches intended circuit design.

### 10. 🏭 Factory Tapeout → Chip Fabrication
- Final stage: design sent to semiconductor foundry (**tapeout**).
- Physical chip fabrication begins.
